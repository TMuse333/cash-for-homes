Add to that the cost of snow removal services, salting walkways, and ensuring driveways remain clear of ice and snow—it all adds up quickly. For vacant properties, these expenses are even more frustrating as there’s no one benefitting from the upkeep."

Combined with heating bills and maintenance costs, property taxes on an unoccupied or underutilized home can create a heavy financial burden. Winter also means fewer buyers in the market, making it harder to sell your house through traditional methods."
