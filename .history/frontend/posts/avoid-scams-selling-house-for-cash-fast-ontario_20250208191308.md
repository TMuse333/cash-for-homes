  Selling your home for cash can be a fast and convenient option, but it's important to be aware of scams. Unfortunately, some fraudulent buyers take advantage of homeowners in distress.

  Not all cash buyers operate with honesty and transparency. Here are some **common red flags** that could indicate a scam:
  - **Pressure to Close Quickly** â€“ Scammers rush you into signing agreements without giving you time to review the terms.
  - **Requests for Upfront Fees** â€“ Legitimate buyers never ask for deposits, application fees, or processing payments before the sale.
  - **Inflated Offers That Seem Too Good to Be True** â€“ Scammers lure sellers with high offers, only to lower them later with fake issues.
  - **No Proof of Funds** â€“ A trustworthy buyer should be able to provide bank statements or a letter proving they have the cash to purchase.
  - **Lack of Online Presence** â€“ If a company has no website, no reviews, or negative feedback, itâ€™s a major red flag.
