## **The Hidden Costs of Keeping a Vacant Property**

Owning a vacant property may seem like a simple investment, but the reality is that maintaining an empty home can result in a variety of hidden costs. Whether you are holding onto a property for future investment or due to unforeseen circumstances, it’s important to understand the ongoing expenses that come with a vacant property.

### **1. Ongoing Maintenance Costs**
A vacant property still requires regular maintenance. From lawn care to cleaning, the costs associated with keeping the property in good condition can add up quickly. Additionally, any repairs needed after wear and tear or from damage caused by weather or pests can become expensive. These costs can be overwhelming, especially when you are not generating any income from the property.

### **2. Higher Insurance Premiums**
Insurance premiums for vacant homes tend to be higher than those for occupied homes. Insurance companies often view vacant properties as a higher risk due to the potential for vandalism, theft, or damage that goes unnoticed. This means that your property could be costing you more to insure than an occupied home, even though you're not benefiting from the insurance coverage in the same way.

### **3. Property Taxes**
Even if your property is sitting vacant, it is still subject to property taxes. In Ontario, property taxes can be a significant financial burden, especially when the property is not being used to generate income. These taxes accumulate year after year and can create a financial strain, making it harder to maintain the property.
